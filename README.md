My submission for CS-322 Website homework.
Any and all of the artwork for the 'Elevator Girl' is created and owned by me.
Otherwise, all other artwork used is not mine and is properly credited.

By the way, the intended method to experience this is to start in the Lobby. It has rules, so please read them.

Also I'll be taking this code and reworking/refining it on my private account so if you somehow find that know that no one stole my code or assets, it's just me.
